- BUGS
  [*] Bug report (android, windows/chrome): tap + to open asset selector > tap outside of asset selector so it is dismissed (not on the x) > tap + to open asset selector => asset selector does not open
  Workaround: changing to Truths/Sector and back to character page makes the + open the asset selector again
  [*] Add Move oracles: Begin a Session, Ask The Oracle
  [*] Changing campaign doesn't fully re-render the sector map.
