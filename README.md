# Stargazer Multiplayer

Hey I made a fork of the original Stargazer to add these features:

- multicharacter/multiplayer support
- image for character support
- that's it

I'm not gonna lie, this is hacky and there are some bugs, but it's good enough for me, hopefully it might be good enough for you

## Some bugs

- clocks probably don't work as intended internally. Nothing that seems to impact the end-user experience though
- I'm pretty sure there are some reactivy errors, this is the first time I use Vue. nothing that can't be fixed reloading the page

## Install the dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)

```bash
quasar dev
```

### Lint the files

```bash
yarn run lint
```

### Build the app for production

```bash
quasar build
```

### Customize the configuration

See [Configuring quasar.conf.js](https://v2.quasar.dev/quasar-cli/quasar-conf-js).
